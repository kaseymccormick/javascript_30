#Javascript 30

Following tutorials by [Wes Bos to create 30 things in 30 days with JS not using boiler plates or libraries.](https://javascript30.com/)  To improve my vanilla js.

I'm doing these exersizes as time allows, meaning sometimes at work and sometimes at home. When I can no longer work on the project at work due to other dependancies i work on these exercises because javascript will rule the world. :) Also in practicing better commiting because work uses different standards.
